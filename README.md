# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This project is a Fake News Detection system that uses machine learning techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) methods and a logistic regression model for classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled news articles, with each article classified as either real or fake. The data is preprocessed to remove noise and improve accuracy.

## Installation
To run this project, install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Removing special characters and converting text to lowercase.
2. Removing stopwords using NLTK.
3. Applying stemming using the Porter Stemmer.
4. Transforming text data into numerical form using TF-IDF Vectorization.

## Model Training
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed text data.
- The model's accuracy is evaluated using `accuracy_score`.

## Usage
Run the script to train the model and make predictions:

```python
python fake_news_detection.py
```

## Performance Evaluation
The accuracy of the model is measured using standard evaluation metrics. The results may vary based on the dataset used.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with different machine learning models such as Random Forest or Neural Networks.
- Improving preprocessing techniques to enhance classification accuracy.
- Integrating the model into a web or mobile application.

## License
This project is open-source and available for modification and distribution.
